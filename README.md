# [Learn Reactive Programming With RxJS][published url]
## Instructor: [Andrew Burgess][instructor url]

Reactive programming is a way of coding with asynchronous data streams that makes a lot of problems easier to solve. RxJS is a popular library for reactive programming that makes it easy to respond to UI events, asynchronous HTTP requests, timeouts, and other data streams in a uniform way. Give it a try and you might find that reactive programming makes a lot of tough coding situations much easier.

In this course, instructor Andrew Burgess will teach you how to use RxJS. You'll see how the simple tools it provides can be applied to a wide range of coding problemsâ€”follow along as Andrew shows you how to handle a number of common challenges with RxJS. After that, you'll get a chance to build a complete, if simple, game using reactive principles.
